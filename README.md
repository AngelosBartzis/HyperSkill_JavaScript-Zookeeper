This is the Zookeeper (JavaScript) project I made myself.

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

Here's the link to the project: [https://hyperskill.org/projects/451](https://hyperskill.org/projects/225?track=5)
